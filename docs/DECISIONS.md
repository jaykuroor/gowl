# DECISIONS — append-only

Format: `## D-NNN — title (date, phase, who)` then Context / Decision / Evidence / Revisit-if.

## D-001 — Rust, single crate, single thread (scaffold)
Context: goal is minimum CPU/RAM/network on niri/Fedora; legacy is Python+Qt.
Decision: Rust stable, no async runtime, `poll()` loop, hand-written small utilities.
Revisit-if: never for v1.

## D-002 — Capture via wlr-screencopy, not portal/PipeWire (scaffold)
Context: niri supports wlr-screencopy (cursor exclusion with damage fixed in 26.04) and
portal+PipeWire DMA-BUF casts. ext-image-copy-capture was an open PR as of mid-2026.
Decision: screencopy SHM first (pull-paced, damage-blocking, no D-Bus/portal dialog);
ext-image-copy-capture preferred automatically when advertised; DMA-BUF variant only if
Phase 5 shows niri's readback cost is over budget.
Revisit-if: niri drops screencopy, or measurements show PipeWire is cheaper end-to-end.

## D-003 — Music capture via dlopen'd libpulse-simple (scaffold)
Context: Fedora runs pipewire-pulse; pa_simple is a tiny blocking API; avoids bindgen.
Decision: `@DEFAULT_MONITOR@`, float32 mono 48 kHz, 1024-sample windows, dlopen on demand.
Revisit-if: profiles show pulse overhead > 0.2% CPU.

## D-004 — Default screen fps 30 (legacy 45) (scaffold)
Context: EMA smoothing makes 30 fps visually equivalent for ambient light; fewer copies,
fewer packets. Device cap is ~40 Hz anyway.
Decision: default 30, configurable. Phase 4 asks the human to compare 30 vs 45 by eye.
